            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> Hello, my name is Patrick Boddy and I am currently a Sophomore at the University of Cincinnati. I am majoring in Information Technology with a focus on
                Cybersecurity and Networking. I am from a family of 5 from the Cleveland area born and raised.  </p>

            <p> For most of my life I have been playing sports. I have played volleyball, hockey, soccer, and lacrosse. Out of them all, hockey is the longest with 17+ years and
                a family of die hard hockey fans. In my High School years I started to transition more to a technological background with my interest in computers.
                I started with basic hardware classes and slowly went over to programming classes with languages such as Ruby and Java. Since I have wanted to pursue something within
                the field and now here I am. </p>



            <p> Within this website you can find different facets of my life. From a little blog that I will put some entries in for different days of my life and lessons I have learned,
                to a bucket list of things I want to do. You can find various projects I want to do and a little portfolio based on my background. I hope you enjoy your time browsing! </p>
